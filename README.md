# Hello There, I'm Lily Comeau (lcomeau01). 
**🎓 Computer Science Student @ Tufts University** 

**📍 Currently Studying Abroad @ Oxford University** 

## 📌 About Me :) 
I started my Computer Science journey in the second semester of my freshman year, immediately declaring my major during my first CS course. I’ve been absolutely in love with the subject ever since. 

I have a deep passion for low-level programming, especially **Assembly** and **C**, but I also have a lot of experience in **Web Design** and languages like **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **Node.js**.

Currently, I’m studying abroad at **Oxford University**, where I’ve been thoroughly enjoying the tutorial system -- working closely with world-renowned tutors and exploring the **theoretical** side of Computer Science in depth.

## 📚 What I'm Studying: 
### At Oxford:
- **Core Courses**: Linear Algebra, Algorithms, Introduction to Proof Systems, and Models of Computation (Computational Theory)

- **Data & AI**: Data Visualization, Databases, AI Planning

- **Digital Systems**: A course that covers Assembly Language, Embedded Systems, I/O Control, Interrupts and Operating Systems

### At Tufts 
- **Low Level Programming, Systems, and Memory**: Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming

- **Mathematics**: Multi-Variable Calculus, Discrete Mathematics

- **Software & Development**: Data Structures, Web Design
