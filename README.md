# Hello There, I'm Lily Comeau (lcomeau01). 
### 🎓 Computer Science Student @ Tufts University
### 📍 Currently Studying Abroad @ Oxford University


I am a student at Tufts University studying Computer Science. 
Currently I am spending a year abroard studying at Oxford University! I have been enjoying the close relationship with my tutors, and really diving deep into a more 
theoretical look at computer science. 
While at Oxford I have studied: 
                                - Linear Algebra and Algorithms
                                - Data Visualization and Databases
                                - AI Planning 
                                - Networks
                                - Models of Computation (Computational Theory) 
                                - Assembly Language, Embedded Systems and I/O, Interrupts and Operating Systems with Process Management
While at Tufts I notably studied: 
                                - Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming
                                - Multi-Variable Calculus 
                                - Discrete Mathematics 
                                - Data Structures 
                                - Web Design
