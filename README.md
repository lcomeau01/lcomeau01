# Hello There, I'm Lily Comeau (lcomeau01). 
**🎓 Computer Science Student @ Tufts University** 

**📍 Visiting Student @ Oxford University (2024 – 2025)** 

## 📌 About Me :) 
I started my Computer Science journey in the second semester of my freshman year, immediately declaring my major during my first CS course. I’ve been absolutely in love with the subject ever since. 

I have a deep passion for low-level programming, especially **Assembly** and **C**, but I also have a lot of experience in **Web Design** and languages like **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **Node.js**.

In my Junior Year, I studied abroad at **Oxford University**, where I thoroughly enjoyed the tutorial system, working closely with world-renowned tutors, and exploring the **theoretical** side of Computer Science in depth.

Now, in my Senior Year, I'm focuisng on growing my knowledge in Data Analytics, taking courses on Visualizing Analytics and Machine Learning + Data Analyzation for Finance. I have a broad scope of knowledge, and I'm excited to grow and learn with professional experience after graduation.
